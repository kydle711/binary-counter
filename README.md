# binary-counter
A customtkinter GUI with a binary counter and reset button

Try changing 'NUM_BITS' in the main.py file to change the number of binary 
digits that will count in the counter. This is a good way to demonstrate to 
someone how binary counting works if they're having trouble visualizing it.
